## Last year of my Engineering                                               july 2020 - may 2020

  This was during last year of my engineering. Peak pandemic hit india, colleges were shut down and running online, Since I had few placement offers in hand plus loads of at home, I decided to experiment and build some cool stuff.
  
  Since it was lockdown in 2020, we were forced to sit at home, so the only things thast I could experiment was with a laptop and an internet connection. I started searching what was I good at and found : I was decent at devlivering topics since I had done it multiple times at my college. Plus I had a tremendous skill gaps in what was taught in college and industry requirement. So, I decided to start a skill development platform to help build real lif skills to engineering grads / learners.
