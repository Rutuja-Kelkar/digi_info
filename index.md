## I built digi_info during last semester of my engineering  
**July 2020 - may 2021**

Peak pandemic hit india, colleges were shut down and running online. Since I had few placement offers in hand plus loads of time at home, I decided to experiment and build some cool stuff.
  
  Since it was lockdown in 2020, we were forced to sit at home, so the only things thast I could experiment was with a laptop and an internet connection. I started searching what was I good at and found : I was decent at delivering topics since I had done it multiple times at my college and events. Plus I had observed a tremendous skill gap between what was taught in college and present industry requirement. So, I decided to start a skill development platform to help build real lif skills to engineering grads / learners. 
  
  I conducted webinars, open discussion sessions, developed an integratedwebinar system that had automated emails, certificate generation, registration forms, timely reminders, integrations and a whole handbook on "How to conduct webinar's from scratch" by oct 2021.
  
  I hosted topics like "How to crack interview rounds", "How to build resume", "how to communicate well", "how to crack technical rounds". I knew C and html language too, took sessions for the same - These were few topics my small mind could think of back then.Made use of multiple tools like hubspot, trello, google analytics, bitly etc to pull off the entire process.
   
   Soon I realised building was not enough and marketing wa next big challenge came my way. I built a small team of 2 juniors from my engineering college and delegated work to them, since it was foolish to do everything alone.Soon a 3000+ student member community which helped them learn skills was built.
   
   When I decided to work on digi_info I knew nothing about "How to build a webinar system", "How to build a community", "How to market", "How to advertise", "How to tap in people's mind about ypu product/ idea", "How to deliver topics effectively", "Ho to talk to people in a convincing manner", "How to get things done in zero budget (because I had no budget at that point of time)", "How to build a team" etc Damn! I knew nothig. 
   
   But I learnt it all because I was resilient enough to say to myself : "Hey there, you'll figure out + there was clear target in my mind". I kept on failing, but everytime I failed or others pointed out where I went wrong, those points were noted and I made sure it was improed the next time.I was able to pull this off in less than 3 months. I observed myself working lightning fast and improvise on the way. 

## Challenges I faced during building digi_info 
  1. How to reach your target audience.
  2. How to build a strong community.
  3. How to convert and retajin your audience.
  4. How to segment audience according  to your product and grow in compaunded rates.
  5. How to stand out and compete with exiting solutions in the market.
  6. How to build and guide a small team.

Learnt all thie and more because I loved solving these high quality challenges. I studied community and marketing models of companies in depth.You amy have a great product, but unless ypu have great distribution which is value based, your customers will not stick with you. A community model has the power to penetrate to your customers heart.

All my learnings, process and set up is documented for future use. I lve documentating stuff! I can go back to conducting webinars anytime I wish too! And Guess what all this was built without spending a single penny, all that was spent was my time, power supply and an internet connection.

 **I made a few mistakes**
  1. In the initial days I tried to ghost myself and not revel my complete identity due to poor confidence, which was a bad idea and it would never work in long run
